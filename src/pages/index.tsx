                    Prism is a language that was born in the wild and raised in the darkness
                    by a schizophrenic monkey. It is held together by duct tape and cracked
                    asbestos-filled spackle. But it has got <code>character</code>; and in
                    this world, that's enough.

                    Prism is currently in prototype. It will soon be released and made open-source.
                    But if you're someone who lives on the edge and is very curious to try it out,
                    you can download the prototype version for your platform and start using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The binaries are updated on a regular basis. Keep track of the release date and
                    use these installers to update Prism every time a new version comes out to stay
                    on the latest version of Prism and get access to all latest features.
